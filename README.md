* 2015 
* Jean Amiouny, Roy Breidi

* Jean Amiouny was at this student bar in Montreal in 2014. He was talking to the waitress and talked to her about how he had some bitcoins, but wanted
to use and spend it as a transaction. After that, he went on and created his company, Shakepay. 

* Shakepay is funded by 12 investors including Boost VC and Charles Machalani which are the most recent investors from a Seried A round on Jan 20th, 2022. 
Shakepay has received a total of $36M in funding over 5 rounds. 


## Business Activities:

* Shakepay allows Canadians to buy or sell Bitcoins and Ethereum throught an app, which then they can send it to their friends and families. 
It also allows them to build their own wealth from buying and storing Bitcoins and Ethereum. 

* The company's intended customer is any Canadians who are the age of 18 and older. The company reached 900,000 customers in 2021.
The company reached roughly about 2% of the population in November and a recent survey showed that 62% of Canadians want to get paid in crypto by 2027. 
This means that the market size of customers is 22 million people, which is roughly 24 times of their current number of customers. 
Shakepay is one of the first Cryptocurrency companies that was founded in Canada that is still operating, which gives them a great reputation and trusts from users. 
Shakepay also encourage users to log in and physically shake their cell phones, in order to receive small amount of rewards in Bitcoins every day. 

* Shakepay launched a P2P payment system that allows Shakepay users to instantly exchange CAD, BTC, and ETH without any fees in October 2020. This would give the users "self-soverign" control over their wealth, as
they can do not require a "middle-man" to do so.

## Recommendations

* Staking, which allows users to earn rewards or interests by holding certain cryptocurrencies. 

* This will draw many new users, as they can passively earn income (or interests) just by leaving certain cryptocurrencies on the platform. 

* Staking pool (just like interest-bearing savings account) 

* “consensus mechanism” also known as Proof of Stake; this ensures all transactions are verified and secured without other 3rd parties like a bank or payment processor in the middle.
